# EASY-TO-DO-Simplify-your-day
This is a To-Do list application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This application allows us the basic operation of a To-Do list i.e, add task and delete task operations. Along with these basic operations, it also allows us to check or uncheck a task which helps to mark a completed task without deleting it completely.

Also, a notification sound has been added to mark the addition of a new task into the list to make it more interactive.
